  off part of the right atrium
- Lock GUI whilst things are loading

Low priority items
- Add help buttons to simulation panel
- Title the JFrame
- Remove or do something with the estimated heart rate
- Implement Tyson CA model
- Hide elements from canvas when they are disabled

Wishlist items
- Implement other CA models
- Code tidy up/refactor
- GUI tidy up

- Add tags to svg elements to apply different settings. For example a path could
  be tagged insulator to indicate that it should not be able to pass an electrical
  wave
- Have a run forever option
- Sort items in combo boxes and the heart tissue menu

User should be able to:
- Select different cellular automata models
- Specify CA parameters for different heart tissue
- Change heart rate
- See wave form for different points
- Change size of visualisation
- Change speed of visualisation
- Kill a specific region of the heart
- Simulate heart block
