TODO
- Draw outline of heart, maybe by overlaying SVG?
- Allow update interval to be specified. Put in pacemaker panel.
- Make visualisation more efficient
- Code tidy up/refactor
- GUI tidy up
- Don't reset simulation each time start is pressed, treat it as being paused
- Add in different heart tissue, SA node, AV node, bundle of His, purkinje fibres
  left and right bundle branches, atria, ventricles
- Use thread to load heart data
- More validation of CA model parameters?
- Add chart as svg overlay?
- Have a profile drop down box so that different tissues can quickly be set to
  different profiles (such as avnode profile)
- Autodetect profile to use

User should be able to:
- Select different cellular automata models
- Specify CA parameters for different heart tissue
- Change heart rate
- See wave form for different points
- Change size of visualisation
- Change speed of visualisation
- Kill a specific region of the heart
- Simulate heart block
