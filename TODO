TODO

High priority items
- Zoom in not working properly
- Find out if bundle branches are insulated and update SVG accordingly
- Find out if valves are excitable and update SVG accordingly
- Correct profiles
- Correct the duration of the stimulus timer
- Simulate the initial repolarisation phase

Medium priority items
- Order tissues in combo box so that the SA node is first and the ventricles last
  in order of the conduction system
- Step forward and pause buttons don't really work
- Zoom action potential chart. (Use correct type of chart)
- Allow for small arbitrary region of cells to be selected and to have their
  parameters changed (so that cells can be killed)
- Allow for a one of stimulation to simulate arrhythmia

Low priority items
- Add help buttons to simulation panel
- Implement Tyson CA model
- Hide elements from canvas when they are disabled
- Determine the optimum size of the stimulus in terms of the number of cells to
  stimulate
- Work out why crosshair cursor doesn't show over JSVGCanvas
- Use mulitple threads/CPU cores to speed up simulation?

Wishlist items
- Incorporate the prepotential in the SA and AV node in the CA model which
  causes the autorhythmicity characterstic of the pacemaker cells
- Incorporate the relative refractory period into the CA model
- Make visualisation more efficient
- Implement other CA models
- Code tidy up/refactor
- GUI tidy up
- More validation of CA model parameters?
- Have a run forever option
- Sort items in combo boxes and the heart tissue menu
- Probability of assigning delta 1 or delta 2 in Nishiyama model
- Devise a better way of applying parameters to different CA models in the profiles

User should be able to:
- Select different cellular automata models
- Specify CA parameters for different heart tissue
- Change heart rate
- See wave form for different points
- Change size of visualisation
- Change speed of visualisation
- Kill a specific region of the heart
- Simulate heart block
