TODO

High priority items
- Add in different heart tissue, SA node, AV node, bundle of His, purkinje fibres
  left and right bundle branches, atria, ventricles
- Make sure things like the bundle branches are on top of the ventricles. Might
  need to devise some sort of priority system

Medium priority items
- Make visualisation more efficient
- Step forward and pause buttons don't really work
- Work out how to integrate bundle of his into visualisation. It currently cuts
  off part of the right atrium
- Lock GUI whilst things are loading
- Devise a better way of applying parameters to different CA models in the profiles

Low priority items
- Add help buttons to simulation panel
- Title the JFrame
- Remove or do something with the estimated heart rate
- Implement Tyson CA model
- Hide elements from canvas when they are disabled
- Fix the location of the stimulus in the centre of the SA node
- Determine the optimum size of the stimulus in terms of the number of cells to
  stimulate
- Work out why crosshair cursor doesn't show over JSVGCanvas

Wishlist items
- Implement other CA models
- Code tidy up/refactor
- GUI tidy up
- More validation of CA model parameters?
- Add tags to svg elements to apply different settings. For example a path could
  be tagged insulator to indicate that it should not be able to pass an electrical
  wave
- Have a run forever option
- Sort items in combo boxes and the heart tissue menu

User should be able to:
- Select different cellular automata models
- Specify CA parameters for different heart tissue
- Change heart rate
- See wave form for different points
- Change size of visualisation
- Change speed of visualisation
- Kill a specific region of the heart
- Simulate heart block
